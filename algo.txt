My encryption algorithm and what it does

I really enjoyed working on this assignment. My first few attempts were pretty frustrating until I discovered than handling characters by ASCII value is much smoother than trying to manipulate characters. The encryption algorithm I've designed is based on the Caesar cipher but incorporates a user supplied key for an added level of security. The length of the key determines the number of characters shifted during encryption for the first line of encryption. For each following line the shift is ?reduced? by 1 which gives each line a slightly different cipher, although they do repeat if there are more lines in the file than characters in the key. Within each line being encrypted a string of random characters is inserted wherever a space character appeared in the plain text. Although there is significant potential for collision from the way the initial shift is calculated decrementing the shift between lines and inserting random characters should make traditional methods of cryptanalysis significantly more challenging.
